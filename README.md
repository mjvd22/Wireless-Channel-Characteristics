# Wireless-Channel-Characteristics
- First part
in the first part of this project a single basestation with more than 10000 users have been implemented. Some specifics considered for this system. This system is using AWGN model. Characteristics that have been simulated:
  *Received Power at given distance
  *Expected SNR at given distance
  *Cosidering path-loss and shadowing effect on received power
- In the second part, Multipath Wireless Channel have been used to simulate the system. As you know in this type of channels we use Rayleigh Fading Channel for modeling each branch. Characteristics that have been simulated in this part:
  Plotting frequency response
  Assuming a Narrowband channel and plotting power of the channel
